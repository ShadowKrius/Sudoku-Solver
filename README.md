## Overview
This repository contains a Python-based Sudoku solver that efficiently solves any valid Sudoku puzzle. The project utilizes a Sudoku API to generate random valid Sudoku boards, allowing users to solve fresh puzzles each time they run the program. The solver is designed to provide quick and accurate solutions while offering a simple interface for inputting and visualizing puzzles.

## Features
- Random Puzzle Generation: Integrates with a Sudoku API to generate random valid Sudoku boards.
- Puzzle Input: Users can input their own Sudoku puzzles into the solver.
- Efficient Solving Algorithm: The solver uses backtracking to efficiently solve any valid Sudoku puzzle.
- User-Friendly Interface: The interface allows for easy visualization of the Sudoku grid before and after solving.
- Instant Solutions: The solver quickly provides the solution, making it easy for users to check their work or solve complex 
  puzzles.

## Technologies Used
- Python: The main programming language used for implementing the Sudoku solver.
- Sudoku API: Used to generate random valid Sudoku puzzles for solving.
- Pygame (optional): Provides a graphical interface for visualizing the Sudoku grid (if a GUI is included).
- Backtracking Algorithm: The core algorithm used for solving the Sudoku puzzles.
